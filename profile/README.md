# Hi there! 👋  

I’m a passionate and experienced software developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. With years of hands-on experience, I’ve worked across various domains, from backend development to cloud infrastructure, and I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, TypeScript  
- **Frameworks**: Django, Flask, React, Node.js, Spring Boot  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **DevOps & Cloud**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Terraform  
- **Tools**: Git, CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus  

### 🔭 Current Focus  
I’m currently diving deeper into **microservices architecture** and **cloud-native development**, exploring how to build resilient and scalable systems. I’m also experimenting with **AI/ML integration** in backend systems to enhance automation and decision-making processes.  

### 🌱 Learning Goals  
- **Rust** for systems programming  
- **GraphQL** for API design  
- **Serverless architectures** on AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions
